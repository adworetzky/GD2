            <p>It was a Sunday, which both my girlfriend and I have off, so she surprised me early in the day. This is her surprise face. My face wasn’t as nice, but I did have clean teeth.</p>

            <h2>10:00 AM</h2>
            <p>We had been wanting to go to the zoo for a while now because they have her favorite animal in the world there: the magical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dik-dik">Dik-Dik</a>.</p>
                <p>It was at this point that I told Kacey I was documenting the day for a project. Her response was to immediately pull out these cool cat-eye sunglasses and say “share these with the class and tell them I say hi.” So… Kacey says “hi”, class.</p>

            <h2>11:00 AM</h2>
            <p>After breakfast at The Paper Moon Diner in Hamden, we found this moving truck with Kacey’s brother’s name on the back which obviously required a picture.</p>

            <h2>12:00 PM</h2>
            <p>Then we finally went to the Rawlings Conservatory. Outside, I handed my camera to Kacey (who hates taking pictures) and she said, “I’m going to make you look moody. Art school people like moody.”  So, I present to you “a moody man standing alone.”</p>

            <h2>1:00 PM</h2>
            <p>Once we were inside, we found tons of interesting flowers and rocks. Kacey and I both spent a long time in Florida before moving here so the super-humid warm air in the conservatory was really nice and made us both smile. She was much more accepting of me taking photos after that. Well, that and the fact that I had snacks. She’s very snack-driven.</p>

            <h2>2:00 PM</h2>
            <p>I like to think I’m not a super awkward person but I have my quirks. However, when people take pictures of me I have no idea what to do with my hands and my mouth makes this weird square shape like I’m trying to keep a frog from jumping out. Kacey finds this very funny so I can see her wait until I’m the most uncomfortable I can possibly be and then *snap*.</p>

            <h2>3:00 PM</h2>
            <p>Not all pictures work well. This is an example of one that did not go well. It made Kacey very sad but I enjoyed it because… seriously look how awkward I am. The photo gods smiled on me and said “nope, we’re going to wash this one out.”

            <h2>4:00 PM</h2>
            <p>We left the conservatory and went to the zoo. We both got very excited about the animals and forgot to take pictures fo almost the whole hour and then I remembered and asked Kacey to take a picture of a giraffe we were looking at. Her version of a joke was to take me instead and title it “The Urban Giraffe.” Is my neck that long?

            <h2>5:00 PM</h2>
            <p>Due to my lack of googling effectively, the Dik-Dik was currently somewhere else because they are redoing the zoo. I have never seen someone’s hope and dreams dashed by such an unassuming object like a tiny sign.</p>
            <p>It might as well have said, “go home dreamer, no fluffy stuff for you today.” It didn’t help that a pack of school children found the sign hilarious because of the poor little Dik-Dik’s name.</p>

            <h2>6:00 PM</h2>
            <p>I handed Kacey my Instax camera because she’s bad with things that have a ton of button. But while she was shooting that one I was shooting on a Canon 6D. It’s always fun at the end of a day to find places where we took pictures of the same thing with different eyes and gear and they come out completely different. I usually make fun of the fact that the vantage point is 2 feet shorter than mine. She’s short. It’s funny. Don’t question my humor.

            <p>My favorite animal is the cheetah and we finally found the exhibit after walking around for ages. Kacey told me to make the same face as the cheetah and right at the last second I changed and pet the picture of him instead. Cheetah doesn’t care. Cheetah is too fast for Kacey's antics.

            <p>Did we get lost on the way home? Yep. Did Kacey blame me and my “perfect sense of direction”? Yep. Am I still in the doghouse for that one? Maybe.

            <p>I didn’t capture the look of disappointment when Kacey couldn’t see a Dik-Dik so I reminded her and then took a photo. This pretty much sums up the day. Thanks, Maryland Zoo, for destroying hopes and dreams.
