        <p>APDC2019 is an annual design conference held to explore and educate designers about the role, practices, and
            most important evolution of political design. The subjects range from the graphic design of the campaigns to
            the creative tactics used in message and positioning of candidates, propositions, and referendums. </p>

            <h4>Scott Thomas</h4>
            <p>As the Design Director for Obama’s 2008 campaign, Scott Thomas led a now-historic political campaign, in
                which branding, design, and the web played a truly pivotal role. Likening the experience to “building an
                airplane in flight,” Scott talks about the creative’s need for triage, the crucial role of incremental
                design improvements, and the importance of getting back to the hand and keeping things simple.</p>

                degree in Advertising and Public relations, and also a studied film as minor in school. Formerly an

            <h4>Donna Lamar</h4>
            <p>Donna started her career as a producer, loved being one and loved learning how to make things. In this,
                she realized that the pursuit of creativity takes many forms and one of those forms needed the
                descriptor creative; so she became a “creative” and erstwhile director. Donna Lamar is an award winning
                creative and production professional with over 15 years of executive level management experience.</p>
