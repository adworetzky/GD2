            <p>APDC2019 is an annual design conference held to explore and educate designers about the role, practices,
                and
                most important evolution of political design. The subjects range from the graphic design of the
                campaigns to
                the creative tactics used in message and positioning of candidates, propositions, and referendums. </p>

        <!-- mission -->
        <h3 id="mission">Mission</h3>
        <section class="left_border">
            <p>Since its inception, the mission of the APDC is to educate designers on how to reach people regardless of
                color, creed, or political ideology. With that in mind, any one in attendance of APDC must respect the
                political ideology of any other attendees, no matter their differences. With speakers and events focused
                on
                the clarity of message and the usage of today’s most advanced tools and practices, leave your party at
                the
                door and remember: We are all here to educate and connect on the basis of accurate and informative
                communications.</p>

                    <h4>Scott Thomas</h4>
                    <p>As the Design Director for Obama’s 2008 campaign, Scott Thomas led a now-historic political
                        campaign,
                        in
                        which branding, design, and the web played a truly pivotal role. Likening the experience to
                        “building an
                        airplane in flight,” Scott talks about the creative’s need for triage, the crucial role of
                        incremental
                        design improvements, and the importance of getting back to the hand and keeping things simple.

                    <h4>Donna Lamar</h4>
                    <p>Donna started her career as a producer, loved being one and loved learning how to make things. In
                        this,
                        she realized that the pursuit of creativity takes many forms and one of those forms needed the
                        descriptor creative; so she became a “creative” and erstwhile director. Donna Lamar is an award
                        winning
                        creative and production professional with over 15 years of executive level management
                        experience.
