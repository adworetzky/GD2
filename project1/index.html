        <h2>It has eight arms, three hearts — and a plan. Scientists aren’t sure how the cephalopods got to be so
            intelligent.</h2>

        <p>To demonstrate how smart an octopus can be, Piero Amodio points to a YouTube video. It shows an octopus
            pulling
            two halves of a coconut shell together to hide inside. Later the animal stacks the shells together like
            nesting
            bowls — and carts them away.</p>

            <p><q>It suggests the octopus is carrying these tools around because it has some understanding they may be
                    useful in the future,</q>
        </div>

        <p>said Mr. Amodio, a graduate student studying animal intelligence at the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/">University
                of Cambridge</a> in Britain.</p>
        <p>But his amazement is mixed with puzzlement.</p>
        <p>For decades, researchers have studied how certain animals evolved to be intelligent, among them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>apes</li>
            <li>elephants</li>
            <li>dolphins</li>
            <li>crows</li>
            <li>parrots</li>
            <li>others</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But all the scientific theories fail when it comes to cephalopods, a group that includes octopuses, squid,
            and cuttlefish. Despite feats of creativity, they lack some hallmarks of intelligence seen in other
            species.</p>
        <div id="pullquote">

            <p><q>It’s an apparent paradox that’s been largely overlooked in the past,</q></p>
        </div>
        <p>said Mr. Amodio. He and five
            other
            experts on animal intelligence explore this paradox in a paper published this month in the journal
            <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(18)30267-2"><cite>Trends in
                    Ecology and Evolution</cite>
            </a>.
        </p>
        <p>For scientists who study animal behavior, intelligence is not about acing a calculus test or taking a car
            apart
            and putting it back together. Intelligence comprises sophisticated cognitive skills that help an animal
            thrive.</p>
        <p>That may include the ability to come up with solutions to the problem of finding food, for example, or a
            knack
            for planning for some challenge in the future.</p>
        <p><strong>Intelligent animals don’t rely on fixed responses to survive — they can invent new behaviors on the
                fly</strong>.</p>
        <p>To measure animal intelligence, scientists observe creatures in the wild — watching a dolphin stick a sponge
            on
            its beak to avoid getting cuts from sharp rocks and coral, for example. Or they bring animals into the lab
            and
            offer them puzzles to solve,
            such as rewarding crows when they learn to rip paper into strips of just the right size.</p>
        <p>Only a few species stand out in these studies, and by comparing them, scientists have identified some shared
            factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The animals have big brains relative to their body size.</li>
            <li>They live for a long time.</li>
            <li>They can form long-lasting social bonds.</li>
        </ul>
